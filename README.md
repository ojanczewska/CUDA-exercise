# CUDA-exercise
Exercises to practice programming in CUDA.

### 1. Prime numbers
Programm checks whether the given number is a prime number or not. An additional version of the functions for the CPU was also made, using the parallelization in the OpenMP standard. 

### 2. Numerical integration
Program calculates the area under the curve, consisting of a given number of points, the coordinates of which are randomly generated.
It includes: points sorting (for GPU - bitonic sort, for CPU - quick sort) and integration (trapezoidal method).

### 3. Matrix operation
Operations that were performed on matrices:
  * matrix transposition
  * matrix addition
  * matrix subtraction
  * matrix scalar multiplication
  * multiplication of 2 matrices
